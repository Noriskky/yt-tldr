# ðŸ“º YT TL;DR

YT TL;DR is a command-line tool and Browser extension that summarizes YouTube videos using LLMs (e.g. Mistral-small, Gemini 2.0) and provides a nice way to save some time by skipping to the most relevant parts of the video. 
The Idea comes from another closed-source tool called [Summd](https://www.summd.app) which is a paid service, so Check him out if you want features like a full Chat Bot about a Video etc.

**Notice:** The Projekt is a WIP and will change to be a lot easier to Host and use, as for now you need to run a Backend Locally and use the Browser extension to get the full experience.
Also some Parts are mostly Written by GH Copilot ðŸ¤– and are not the best, the reason for that I wanted a Quick and dirty alternative to Summd and I was just lazy ðŸ’¤ and lastly this is my Projekt using Deno and Typescript so Roast me to medium rare please.
